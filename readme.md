# Cypress Nextra demo

A default [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) project to demo cypress on. Used at a code-along talk in student events hosted by @lyytioy.
The talk focuses on setting up Cypress and testing with it. Nextra is used to provide a quickly set up application to test with Cypress.

## Running Cypress tests

Start up dev environment
```
npm run dev
```

Open Cypress Test Runner
```
npm run cypress:open
```

Run Cypress tests headless
```
npm run cypress
```

Cypress tests are also ran on push by a Github action. Those are recorded to the Cypress Dashboard.

## Demo
The demo application is a [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) template which is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter template for documentation. The documentation is based on MDX files which support Markdown as well as React components.

Deploy your own Nextra app on Vercel
